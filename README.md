# Pyblock Threater

My earliest attempt at making a game after my first few weeks of coding. The game was **not** very good and had **tons** of bugs/glitches. 
It was a fun and memorable experience nonetheless! I keep the game around to remember how far I have come, and to motivate myself to work harder.

A very simple 2D platformer game with co-op vs. mode. Two players would compete to collect orbs which appear randomly (certain distances away from both players). Game was made with pygame, animated sprites and 2 player controls. Both the name and basis of the game was heavily inspired by the popular "Battleblock Theater"

Above is an extremely dangerous and intimidating raccoon obstacle that does not only bring pain and struggles to our beta testers, but also *may* sometimes cause them to be stuck in a block or two after collision.

A very plain looking start screen. 
This concludes my very simple 10th grade coding project.
